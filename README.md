DATA COLLECTION AND DATA PREPROCESSING

Data preprocessing is the process of preparing and cleaning the data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or contains errors. Preprocessing helps in handling these issues to make the data more suitable for modeling.

Steps in Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values (e.g., filling, removing).

Removing duplicate data.

Correcting inconsistent data (e.g., typos or incorrect formats).

Data Integration:

Combining data from different sources.

Ensuring consistency across datasets.

Data Transformation:

Normalization/Standardization: Scaling features to bring them into the same range.

Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).

Discretization: Converting continuous data into discrete bins.

Data Reduction:

Reducing the volume but keeping the integrity of data (e.g., feature selection, PCA).

Helps in reducing computational cost and overfitting.

Data Splitting:

Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets.

Ensures that models are evaluated on unseen data.

Why is Data Preprocessing Important?
Improves Accuracy: Clean and well-prepared data leads to better model performance.

Removes Noise: Eliminates irrelevant information that can confuse the model.

Faster Processing: Optimized data reduces training time and increases efficiency.
